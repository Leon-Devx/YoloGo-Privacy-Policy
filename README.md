Yolo Go: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Yolo Go app for Android!

This is an action runner platformer game developed by Yoloway. The game is available on Google Play.

As an avid gamer myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this game to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (save data) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
